# Mapping Queretaro
Use INEGI information to plot a map from Queretaro Localities.

Detailed information from the state of Queretaro, municipalities and localities can be found here:

<https://www.inegi.org.mx/app/biblioteca/ficha.html?upc=702825218898>

The format of the information is Esri Shapefile (shp). We need the python library pyshp to analyze the information.

I followed the implementation from the following link

and I adapted the details to INEGI information.
